        It's just this website! I built this site to showcase both who I am and
        what I've done. Also computer vision is cool ðŸ˜Ž

      <p>
        I used ML Kit's hand landmark detection to detect the position of a
        user's hand using their webcam. I took the mean of the landmarks
        corresponding to the palms and had the website cursor follow that point
        (scaled to the website's window size). I also used ML Kit's gesture
        recognition to detect when the user makes an open-hand, closed-hand, or
        ILY gesture to move, click, and activate the context menu. If I ever
        want to add my own custom gestures in the future, I would consider
        making a model in tensorflow/pytorch (similar to my RPS classifier
        project) and using that on the hand landmarked data instead of ML Kit's
        pre-made gesture recognition.
