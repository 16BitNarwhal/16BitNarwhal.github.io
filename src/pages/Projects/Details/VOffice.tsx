        Inspiration
      </h2>
      <p>
        My team and I were participating in{' '}
        <a href='https://uwaterloo.ca/events/events/velocity-presents-innovation-challenge-imagining-future'>
          Velocity's Reimagining the Future of Finance hackathon
        </a>{' '}
        in September. The hackathon was sponsored by BMO, Unity, and Rogers. The
        challenge was to assist future generations with financial literacy. Many
        ideas led to educating finance through video games, but we wanted
        something that could be used as a tool rather than just an educational
        game. So, we came up with VOffice, a platform that allows you to
        collaborate with your coworkers in real time in a VR environment, and
        seek advice from AI-Powered Advisors. Eventually we ended up winning the
        hackathon

      <h2>Development</h2>
      <p>
        For the graphics, we used the 3D Unity Editor. We found some premade
        assets online, given our limited experience with 3D modelling, and we
        put them together to create our office environment. We made most of our
        objects interactable, and for an extra-fun experience, we included a
        couple of easter eggs.
      </p>
      <p>
        For our backend, we used C# and we scripted in the integrated Visual
        Studio IDE. We integrated OpenAI APIs, including text completion and
        Whisper speech-to-text, in order to power our advisors. In order to be
        able to make our advisors speak their <b>LLM-powered</b> thoughts, we
        utilized Amazon Web Service's (AWS) Polly model.
